It supports hot-reload,\ncode highlighting, easy config, looks really good and it's very fast. In some ways this template was ahead of its time.\nHot reload 2 years ago was still in its infancy in the js world! Thank you <a href=\"https://github.com/sergiokopplin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sergio A.Kopplin</a>\nfor your hard work making this theme.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gatsby-is-not-a-good-idea\"><a href=\"#gatsby-is-not-a-good-idea\" aria-label=\"gatsby is not a good idea permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Gatsby is not a good idea</h2>\n<p>I must admit initially I wasn't convinced that moving to Gatsby is a good idea. Firstly it's like starting a new project.\nYou are designing a website and implementing it in react. This takes time and time I don't have. I am already maintaining about\n7 or 8 open source projects and I still have a blog to update.</p>\n<p>Secondly what benefits do I gain moving to Gatsby? Indigo is already giving me hot reload, it looks good and is really fast. Do\nI have to move? This is a common developer mentality.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If it ain't broke don't fix it\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lastly, is it an overkill? It's just a static blog site, does it really need to be on the bleeding edge frontend engineering?</p>\n<h2 id=\"gatsby-is-a-great-idea\"><a href=\"#gatsby-is-a-great-idea\" aria-label=\"gatsby is a great idea permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Gatsby <em>is</em> a great idea</h2>\n<p>Yes the initial bootstrap to start a new project is time consuming but it's definitely worth it beyond any doubt.\nThe ecosystem is soo good! Markdown support is first class through <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">gatsby-transformer-remark</a>.\nYou query almost anything you need about your post through graphql! I didn't think you could use graphql this way, so\nit's pretty innovative. You can cut down the design time by \"mimicking\" some of the existing blog sites. I must admit\nI get a lot of inspiration from medium.</p>\n<p>Secondly benefits? Loads! You get a spa with kick-ass performance and a world class development experience; live-reload, linting,\nprettier, testing. You don't just get benefits, you get an entirely different realm of experience. To hammer the nail home,\nthere's a plugin for pretty much anything you need like youtube support, syntax highlighting, styled components, etc.</p>\n<p>Lastly is it an overkill? It is just a static blog site but there's definitely a lot of room for improvement. As frontend\nengineers, we should embrace progress because that's how we learn and improve. Gatsby is one such progress and I'm so glad\nI embraced it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thanks\"><a href=\"#thanks\" aria-label=\"thanks permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Thanks</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylemathews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kyle Mathews</a> thank you for introducing gatsby to this world.</p>\n<hr>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"date":"September 18, 2018","path":"/gatsby","title":"Hello Gatsby","files":[{"name":"hero","publicURL":"/static/hero-3c37ea0a2611c7feda7ebef2ef78f554.jpg"}],"tags":["gatsby","js","gastbyjs","react","reactjs","spa","migrate","migration","gatsby2","reactjunkie"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
