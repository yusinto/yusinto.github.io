I was hoping for more advanced topics\nlike new features in graphql or advanced animations with <a href=\"https://popmotion.io/pose/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pose</a> or something new that\nwill pique my learning curiosity. There were inspirational moments in the conference when I felt a little\nchallenged, stirred but these were few. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Mjackson/react-loop-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Jackson</a> was the highlight of the conference.\nHe was the keynote speaker and he was very good. His talk was largely based around hooks and how it has\nchanged React. There were many good ideas in his demos. He was \"live\" coding custom hooks just to show\nthe possibilities: useLogger, usePersistentState, useThunk all of which are really super cool. I really\nlike his talk. He's very funny too.</p>\n<hr>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"June 27, 2019","path":"/react-loop","title":"React Loop Chicago","files":[{"name":"hero","publicURL":"/static/hero-73ccdb361bdf6d215ab1dc3e2d357b33.png"}],"tags":["react","loop","chicago","conference","js","javascript","hooks","review"]}}},"pageContext":{}}
