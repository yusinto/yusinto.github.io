There is\na diverse selection of speakers talking about a diverse range of topics in depth and the food are fantastic! This  year\nNYC Day was held at the Brooklyn Bowl which is a bowling club. It's a beautiful place with actual bowling alleys!\nWhat a unique and fun way to have a conference. Definitely out of the box thinking.</p>\n<p>And there's tea! Black, green, and many others. I was so grateful. Here are some highlights from the conference which\nI find interesting. </p>\n<h2 id=\"highlights\"><a href=\"#highlights\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Highlights</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/donavon/hook-flow/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Donavon West</a> raised an interesting topic about the\nlifecycle flow of a hook component. I must admit I have never thought of lifecycle steps for hooks before. I recommend\nspending a minute or two looking at his <a href=\"https://github.com/donavon/hook-flow/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flow diagram</a> to\nunderstand the nature of mounting, rendering and unmounting hooks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dabit3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nader Dabit</a> introduced AWS Amplify which is quite a beast. The official\ndefinition is equally very broad so the best description is it's Amazon's answer to Prisma (ex-graphcool). The demo\nwas quite impressive. He was able to create a graphql endpoint through the cli with crud methods in a couple of minutes.\nLike Prisma.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jared Palmer</a> gave a good and almost customary talk on performance and react.\nI learnt that you can run lighthouse now straight from devtools from the Audits tab. Another cool thing is <a href=\"https://github.com/johnmichel/Library-Detector-for-Chrome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">library detector for chrome</a>\nwhich tells you what libraries/frameworks are used on a website. It's so cool! Another cool thing is <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/size-plugin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">size-plugin</a>\nwhich prints the size of your webpack bundle and the size difference compared to the last build. I think I'm going\nto incorporate this as part of my development pipeline to watch out for size bloats.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\"><a href=\"#summary\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>I enjoyed parts of the conference more than others I must admit. The attendees were awesome I had a chance\nto socialise and network with many awesome developers in the area. It was a small decent size group. The theme\nof the conference was unmistakable: hooks, hooks and hooks. That said, the food was not very good and\nthey didn't have tea, only coffee. Perhaps next time these could be better.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading! </p>\n<hr>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"date":"September 27, 2019","path":"/react-day-nyc","title":"React Day NYC","files":[{"name":"hero","publicURL":"/static/hero-3ea1dd33a67668ece182d673722c5125.png"}],"tags":["react","graphql","native","nyc","day","new york","city","conference","reactjunkie"]}}},"pageContext":{}}
