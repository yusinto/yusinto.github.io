Passionate about react graphql and making things fast."}},"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I was very lucky this month to have a chance to attend React Loop, Chicago's first react conference.\nOverall the depth of the talks were a little too introductory to me. I was hoping for more advanced topics\nlike new features in graphql or advanced animations with <a href=\"https://popmotion.io/pose/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pose</a>.\nThere were inspirational moments in the conference when I felt a little challenged, stirred but these were few. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Mjackson/react-loop-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Jackson</a> was the highlight of the conference.\nHe was the keynote speaker and he was very good. His talk was largely based around hooks and how it has\nchanged React. There were many good ideas in his demos. He was \"live\" coding custom hooks just to show\nthe possibilities: useLogger, usePersistentState, useThunk all of which are really super cool. I really\nlike his talk. He's very funny too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dev.to/httpjunkie/react-loop-p8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eric Bishard</a> further expanded on hooks talking\nabout state management with hooks. He gave an awesome demo implementing a TODO app with hooks. The app demonstrates\nhow to use <code class=\"language-text\">useReducer</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">useEffect</code> to manage state. I am already familiar with these hooks but to see them being\nimplemented live and explained in detail is a good learning experience. These hooks combined with <code class=\"language-text\">useThunk</code> from MJ\nabove really indicates that React is becoming a more self-sufficient library i.e. we don't need redux anymore.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://houssein.me/progressive-react\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Houssein Djirdeh</a> gave a good and almost customary talk on performance and react.\nI learnt that you can run lighthouse now straight from devtools from the Audits tab. Another cool thing is <a href=\"https://github.com/johnmichel/Library-Detector-for-Chrome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">library detector for chrome</a>\nwhich tells you what libraries/frameworks are used on a website. It's so cool! Another cool thing is <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/size-plugin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">size-plugin</a>\nwhich prints the size of your webpack bundle and the size difference compared to the last build. I think I'm going\nto incorporate this as part of my development pipeline to watch out for size bloats.</p>\n<hr>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"date":"June 27, 2019","path":"/react-loop","title":"React Loop Chicago","files":[{"name":"hero","publicURL":"/static/hero-73ccdb361bdf6d215ab1dc3e2d357b33.png"}],"tags":["react","loop","chicago","conference","js","javascript","hooks","review"]}}},"pageContext":{}}
